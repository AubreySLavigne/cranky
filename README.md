# Cranky Numbers

A *Cranky Number* is an integer than can be sliced, such that the two halves
multiply by each other to result in a product reversed from the original number.

For example, the number `351` is considered cranky. This number consists of
two parts, `3` and `51`, which multiply together to form `153`, which is the
original number `351` reversed.
